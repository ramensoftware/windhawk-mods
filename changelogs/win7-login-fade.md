## 1.1 ([Feb 17, 2026](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/407aa7889e7c75d5eca0310b16dfc82055846d1a/mods/win7-login-fade.wh.cpp))

* Fixed the logon fade not respecting and resetting the previous gamma value, including those set by ICC profile, color calibration, some display drivers' color settings, f.lux, etc.
* Removed the 'fade on lock' feature, as it turns out, even Windows 7 did not fade when locking. That feature was also overly complicated and prone to bugs.
