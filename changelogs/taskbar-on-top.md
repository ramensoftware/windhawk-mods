## 1.1.5 ([Oct 26, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/6a179f7c2bc4de25e0d72167534b5583c43db03e/mods/taskbar-on-top.wh.cpp))

  * The account card at the bottom of the Start menu is no longer truncated.
* Added a workaround for the edges of the taskbar being non-clickable in some cases.
* Added a workaround for compatibility with ExplorerPatcher. Previously, if the mod was used together with ExplorerPatcher, the Start menu could be misplaced at the edge of the screen.

## 1.1.4 ([Jul 17, 2025](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/c094b860efa76d6d481a26237c089695d6f78406/mods/taskbar-on-top.wh.cpp))

## 1.0.5 ([Nov 3, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/25345e441de9f8b292d8a2d316c06ac6869e3ced/mods/taskbar-on-top.wh.cpp))

## 1.0.4 ([Oct 27, 2024](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/blob/8195a025df8ce6bfbd9a3dab732811619d75d205/mods/taskbar-on-top.wh.cpp))

* Fixed the start menu opening on the left side of the screen, even if the icons on the taskbar are centered. The bug was caused by the attempt to change the incorrect jump list animation in version 1.0.3. As a result, if icons are centered, jump list animation will be incorrect again. This affects only Windows 11 23H2, there's no such issue on Windows 11 24H2.
