* Added support for long paths.
* Reduced footprint for processes which never use a file list control.
* Reduced footprint if "Everything" 1.4 isn't used. That's yet another reason to switch to ["Everything" 1.5 Alpha](https://www.voidtools.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9787), which is also about 20x faster at size query operations. Despite the "Alpha" label, it's stable for daily use according to users' feedback and my own experience.
* Fixed a crash in 32-bit programs when the "Use IEC terms" option is enabled and the "Use MB/GB for large files" option isn't enabled.
* Fixed Everything hanging in some cases if its executable name is Everything64.exe and not Everything.exe.
* Fixed slow file list loading when browsing slow network share folders.
* Fixed Explorer showing incorrect operation sizes in some cases, such as when extracting files from a 7-Zip archive.
