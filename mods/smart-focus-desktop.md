# Smart Focus Desktop 🎯

**Reclaim your visual space. A distraction-free desktop experience for designers and minimalists.**

Windows desktops often become cluttered, distracting you from deep work. **Smart Focus Desktop** transforms your wallpaper into a dynamic workspace that adapts to your context.

### ✨ The "Focus" Workflow
This mod introduces a seamless behavior to Windows Explorer:
1.  **Deep Work Mode:** As soon as you open any window (Browser, Figma, IDE), your desktop icons **automatically vanish**. Your peripheral vision stays clean.
2.  **Access Mode:** Need a file? Simply **click once** on any empty area of your wallpaper.
    * All windows minimize instantly (Win+D style).
    * Your icons reappear immediately.

### 🚀 Why install this?
* **Zero Glitch:** Uses native visibility rendering for maximum stability. No flickering, no black backgrounds.
* **Performance First:** Built with a high-performance polling engine (10ms) that consumes virtually 0% CPU.
* **Smart Interaction:** It intelligently distinguishes between a "Click" (to show desktop) and a "Drag" (to select files). It won't interfere with your normal usage.
